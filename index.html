		<section class = "about"> Welcome to Me + Julia! My name is Simone and I think baking is rad. I also think Julia Child is my spirit animal. I bought <em>Baking with Julia</em> back in college from a second-hand bookstore and it has since become my baking bible. Me + Julia is a way to document my baking adventure through all of her cookbook. That's right, ALL (and let's be honest, it'll help hold me accountable to actually doing this). Come along and Bon Appetit!</section>
